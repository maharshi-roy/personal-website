title: "Hybrid Intelligence Approach to Container Loading Problem"
summary: "In this practical version of a 3-D container loading problem with the added challenge of handling multi-drop (destination) constraint, we provide a heuristic-based algorithm that gives better packing efficiency sujected to orientation and position constraints of the packages than conventional 3-D knapsack problems."
