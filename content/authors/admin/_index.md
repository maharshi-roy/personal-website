I'm a Senior Software Engineer working on the [Adobe Production Print Engine](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/pdfprintengine.html). I specialize in Color and Transparency handling. I actively engage with major OEM customers like **HP, Scitex, FujiXerox, Ricoh** etc to bring about newer workflows all the while ensuring greater color accuracy and high-fidelity color reproduction. I'm currently working on an independent product line targeted towards textile OEMs using spectral reflectance data of inks through [CxF](https://www.iso.org/standard/61503.html) to bring about accurate color reproduction under varying lighting conditions. Alongside work, I seek out opportunities for mentorship and have been involved in training of many campus joinees and lateral hires in our team. \

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using Machine Learning and AI. My focus always lies in bridging the gap between AI/ML and other disciplines like IoT, Distributed Systems, etc to bring about a pragmatic solution to challenging problems in the field of Machine Learning. I have been fortunate to work on several projects focused on ML, CV and Heuristic Algorithms under the guidance of [Prof. Anupam Agarwal](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=mVXjhhgAAAAJ&hl=en) during my college years. I completed my Master's thesis titled [Distributed Machine Learning using Consumer Devices](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DhBVGJCaVNzDpjv0kt2Gw-aqRPcZWUrA/view?usp=sharing) under [Dr. Vijay Chaurasiya](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=g_NjKDQAAAAJ&hl=en) in my final year. \

Besides being a techie, I'm an avid [reader](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18742741-maharshi-roy) and an [anime](https://myanimelist.net/profile/strategist_roy) aficionado. Occasionally, I also write [blogs](https://medium.com/@maharshiroy) on subjects I find interesting.
