I'm a Senior Software Engineer working on the [Adobe Production Print Engine](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/pdfprintengine.html). I specialize in Color and Transparency handling. My responsibilities include design and implementation of new color workflows and features for ensuring greater color accuracy and high-fidelity color reproduction upon rasterization. I'm actively involved in developer support for major OEM customers like **HP, Scitex, FujiXerox, Ricoh** etc. Currently working on CxF-based color transformations for accurate color reproduction under various lighting conditons and substrate materials for textile-focused OEMs.\

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using Machine Learning and AI. My focus always lies in bridging the gap between AI/ML and VR, Distributed Technology, Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery etc to develop applications solving real-world problems. I have been fortunate to work under the guidance of [Prof. Anupam Agarwal](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=mVXjhhgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Vijay Chaurasiya](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=g_NjKDQAAAAJ&hl=en) (under whom I completed my masters thesis) during my college years.\

Outside my profession, I'm an avid fan of [anime](https://myanimelist.net/profile/strategist_roy), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18742741-maharshi-roy) & [gaming](https://steamcommunity.com/id/strategist_/). I like to play *Rainbow Six Siege* during my pastime.
